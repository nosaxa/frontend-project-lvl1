## What is this?

This is five mathematical games kit which let users check their mathematical and logical skills to find gaps in knowledge

## How to start using the program:

1. Make sure, that you have installed node and npm on you computer. You can check it by typing following commands: `node -v`, `npm -v`
2. Clone the program on you local computer from this repository: `git clone git@github.com:nosaxa/frontend-project-lvl1.git terminal-games`
3. Go to the _terminal games_ directory: `cd terminal-games`
4. Install all dependencies: `make install`
5. Run the games by typing their names: `brain-calc`, `brain-even`, `brain-gcd`, `brain-prime`, `brain-progression`

```
- Brain-calc: show an expression and ask the result
- Brain-even: show a number and ask if it is even?
- Brain-gcd: show two numbers and ask a common gratest divisor
- Brain-prime: show a number and ask if it is prime
- Brain-progression: show progression, hide one number and ask it
```
